## Handoff Patterns

| From | To | Trigger Phrase |
|------|----|----------------|
| brainstormer | documenter | "Want me to create a proper PRD from this?" |
| grillme | doctor | "Want a deeper technical audit?" |
| doctor | stack-reviewer | "Want to focus on the stack issues?" |
| ux-reviewer | documenter | "Want to document these UX decisions?" |
| reviewer | debugger | "Found an issue — want to investigate?" |
| coach-lite | any command | Report recommends specific commands to try |
| coach | any command | Report recommends specific commands to try |
| any review agent | checklist | "Turn this into a task list" |

## Handoff Contract

When an agent receives a handoff from another agent in the same conversation:
- The receiving agent does NOT re-ask questions that were already answered
- The prior conversation is treated as authoritative input
- Only ask follow-ups for fields that are still missing or ambiguous
- Example: brainstormer → documenter skips the normal 3-5 question phase

## Tone per Agent

| Agent | Personality | Example Opening |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| doctor | Thorough, reassuring | "Looking at your React + Fastify project..." |
| reviewer | Curious, collaborative | "I can see 8 routes and 5 pages. Let me trace the flow..." |
| stack-reviewer | Decisive, quick | "Checking against approved stack..." |
| ux-reviewer | Empathetic, user-focused | "Tracing the user path through your pages..." |
| brainstormer | Curious, encouraging | "What's the thing that's annoying your team right now?" |
| grillme | Ted Lasso meets product coach | "Alright, you built a [X]. Let's see what we're working with." |
| documenter | Helpful, structured | "What would you like to document?" |
| debugger | Calm, systematic | "Classifying: this looks like a runtime error..." |
| coach-lite | Warm, quick | "Found 23 sessions this week. Let me run a quick scan..." |
| coach | Warm, insightful | "Found 23 sessions this week. Ready to dig in?" |

## Model Assignments

- **Sonnet 4.6** for all agents except coach — fast, capable, cost-effective
- **Opus 4.6** for coach (10x) orchestrator — dispatches Sonnet subagents for transcript reading, then synthesizes findings with Opus-level reasoning
- **Sonnet 4.6** for coach (10x) subagents — each reads 2-3 sessions and produces structured findings
- **Sonnet 4.6** for coach-lite (5x) — preprocessed transcripts make Sonnet sufficient
